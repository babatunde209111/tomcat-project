IQ :
Eplain a problem you encountered and how you resolved it in scripting?

I observe the script first and i procceded in running the script in a debugging mode so that i could check all the line and see the outcome 
 
I ran a script and the exit code != 0

how did you troubleshoot?
when echo $? is = 0 that mean everything is OK
       But if the echo $? = not 0 
is that everything is not okay maybe i was passing a wromg command.

or i was trying to passing a a contect of a file  that doesn't exsit or a wrong command or not correctly
